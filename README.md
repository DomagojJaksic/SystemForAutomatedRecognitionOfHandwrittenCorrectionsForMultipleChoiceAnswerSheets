Master thesis

In the process of filling out the exam sheets with questions with multiple choice answers, students sometimes make mistakes. Incorrect entries of the answers can be corrected by entering the letter label of the desired answer in the correction table. Handwritten answer corrections complicate the process of automated exam evaluation because the operator needs to manually review them and enter the corrected answer into the existing system. As a part of this graduate thesis, a system for automated recognition of handwritten corrections for multiple-choice answer sheets has been developed. The thesis provides an insight into the used data sets for training and testing the system. Furthermore, the procedures for normalizing the rotation of the exam sheet, detecting the answer correction table in the exam sheet, and detecting the answer correction table fields are explained in detail. Models that recognize which letter label is written in the detected field of the answer correction table are also presented in the thesis. In addition to the model architecture, the results that the models achieved on the test set of the exam sheets are listed.
